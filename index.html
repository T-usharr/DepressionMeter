                  <h6 class="py-1 card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Sadness, feeling down, and having a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities are familiar feelings for all of us. But if they persist and affect our lives substantially, the issue may be depression.</h6>
                  <p class="card-text fs-5 text-dark py-4">Depression is a common illness worldwide, with an estimated 3.8% of the population affected, including 5.0% among adults and 5.7% among adults older than 60 years. Approximately 280 million people in the world have depression.<span class="text-success fw-bolder"> "Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived emotional responses to challenges in everyday life."</span> Especially when recurrent and with moderate or severe intensity, depression may become a serious health condition. It can cause the affected person to suffer greatly and function poorly at work, at school and in the family. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide. Over 700 000 people die due to suicide every year. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death in 15-29-year-olds.

                    Although there are known, effective treatments for mental disorders, more than 75% of people in low- and middle-income countries receive no treatment.  Barriers to effective care include a lack of resources, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders. In countries of all income levels, people who experience depression are often not correctly diagnosed,
                     and others who do not have the disorder are too often misdiagnosed and prescribed antidepressants.
